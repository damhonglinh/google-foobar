I don't remember exactly what this problem is but it's about how to cut a round cake that have candies with different colors on itself so that all pieces are exactly the same (same size and same candy colors).

Input is a string of characters, each of which is the color of the candies. Output is the maximum number of pieces that can be cut.

### Note
I over thought a bit that because the cake is round, the last character of the string can link to the first character. 
In other words, the next character of the last character is the first character. This was a valid point but I soon found that it didn't matter.
